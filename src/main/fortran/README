These files are slightly modified from software provided by Alan Genz:

http://www.math.wsu.edu/faculty/genz/software/software.html

The original files have some overlap with each other and so I have
commented out the appropriate parts so that they can be used as one
library from Java.

Note: The compiled library is NOT thread safe, due to the use of
global variables in the FORTRAN code. To use it from multiple threads,
create multiple copies and load one from each thread.
